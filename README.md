# Heart-Disease-Prediction
# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict the presence of heart disease in a patient using machine learning algorithms. The goal is to leverage data science and healthcare data to support early diagnosis and decision-making.

## 🧠 Project Overview

This notebook trains and evaluates different ML models on the popular Heart Disease UCI dataset. It includes data preprocessing, model training, performance evaluation, and prediction functionalities.

### ✅ Key Features

- Cleaned and preprocessed healthcare dataset
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature selection and transformation
- ML model training (Logistic Regression, KNN, Random Forest, etc.)
- Performance metrics: accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report
- Interactive predictions

## 🗃 Dataset

The dataset used is the [Heart Disease UCI dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cherngs/heart-disease-cleveland-uci) which contains 14 features including age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, cholesterol, fasting blood sugar, etc.
